Darklight Nova: Core
====================

The Darklight Nova Core installation is an open source security vulnerability simulation platform. It's similar to [CyberNEXS](https://www.saic.com/cyberNEXS/) or the CyberPatriot Competition System, though open source & free.

The client informs the user of the current state of the simulation through a generated HTML file.

# Documentation
For documentation, see the [wiki](https://github.com/darklight-studios/darklight-nova-core/wiki)

# Code Contributions

All code added and removed must be submitted via Pull Request. In addition, submitted code must meet the following requirements:

* We use tabs, not spaces. (Tab size = 4)
* We attempt to follow the [Java Coding Conventions](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html) as specified by Oracle.
* We prefer our functions(like this) not functions (like this) or functions ( like this ).
* Issues and plugins should not be submitted to the core, instead, they should be linked to on the wiki on a separate Github repository.
* Added code should be documented using [JavaDoc](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html).

Any help is highly appreciated, though if submitted code appears very roundabout or innefficient, we will not hesitate to voice our concerns, or offer suggestions to improve it before merging it into the master branch.

# Support

For the time being, submit support questions & inquiries through Github Issues, though in the future we'll be around via IRC during odd hours of the day for generic questions & getting started.
