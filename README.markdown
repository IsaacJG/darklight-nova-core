Darklight Nova: Core
====

The Darklight Nova Core installation is an open source security vulnerability simulation platform. It's similar to CyberNEXS or the CyberPatriot Scoring System, though open source & free.

The server is designed to operate on a smaller scale, potentially any number of clients sending updates to NodeJS powered web backend, which then parses the results and displays them in a variety of formats.

In addition, the client informs the user of the current state of the simulation through a Java & generated HTML file, independently of the server. This can allow a server module to be entirely non-existent, while maintaining critical functionality.

### Code Contributions

All code added and removed must be submitted via Pull Request. In addition, submitted code must follow the following:

* We use tabs, not spaces.
* We attempt to follow the [Java Coding Conventions](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html) as specified by Oracle.
* We prefer our functions(like this) not functions (like this) or functions ( like this ).
* Vulnerability modules should not be submitted to the core, instead, they should be linked to on the wiki on a separate Github repository.
* Added code should be documented using [JavaDoc](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html).

We will not accept code that provides no useful benefit or is implemented in an exceptionally roundabout way that could be improved.

### Support

For the time being, submit support questions & inquiries through Github Issues, though in the future we'll be around via IRC during odd hours of the day for generic questions & getting started.
